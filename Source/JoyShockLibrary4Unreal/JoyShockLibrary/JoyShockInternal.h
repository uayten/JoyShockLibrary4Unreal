// JoyShockInternal.h - The device registry, shared between the files that were once one .cpp.
//
// Splitting JoyShockLibrary.cpp into four files (registry, polling, enumeration, Blueprint API) turned a
// handful of file-static helpers and globals into a surface those files share, which is what this header
// declares. It is internal: nothing outside this module's implementation should include it, and nothing
// here is a Blueprint type. The public face of the plugin is JoyShockBlueprintLibrary.h.
//
// Who defines what:
//   JoyShockLibrary.cpp   the globals below, the handle helpers, the LED masks
//   JoyShockPolling.cpp   pollIndividualLoop
#pragma once
