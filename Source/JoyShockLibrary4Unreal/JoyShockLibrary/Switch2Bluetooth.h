// Bluetooth transport for the Nintendo Switch 2 controllers.
//
// These controllers do not speak Bluetooth HID. Over the air they are a plain BLE peripheral with a
// vendor GATT service, so Windows never enumerates them as a gamepad and hidapi cannot see them at all --
// which is why this lives beside the HID code rather than inside it. Everything here talks to that GATT
// service directly: scan for the advertisement, connect, subscribe to the input characteristic, and write
// commands and vibration data to their own characteristics.
//
// The implementation is Windows-only (WinRT) and is deliberately kept behind this plain interface: no
// WinRT type appears in this header, so the rest of the plugin includes it without inheriting either the
// WinRT headers or their exception requirements.

// Nintendo's company identifier, as it appears in the manufacturer data of a controller's advertisement.
