// JoyShockEnumeration.cpp - Finding controllers and opening them.
//
// One pass of ConnectDevices walks every HID device the platform reports, decides which are controllers
// this plugin drives, works out whether each is one it has seen before (by MAC where readable, by HID path
// otherwise), opens it, runs its family's init handshake and starts its polling thread.
//
// The awkward cases it exists to get right: a controller paired over Bluetooth and then plugged in appears
// twice and must stay one device, and a device that opens but never delivers a report is a phantom that
// must not be retried forever.
//
// Split out of JoyShockLibrary.cpp; the registry it fills is declared in JoyShockInternal.h.
