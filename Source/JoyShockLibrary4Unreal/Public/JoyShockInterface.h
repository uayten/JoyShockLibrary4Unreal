	/**
	 * DualShock 4 / DualSense touchpad, as ordinary gamepad axes.
	 *
	 * Unreal's Touch1..Touch10 keys are the wrong place to look for these, which is what everyone tries
	 * first. Those are TOUCHSCREEN keys: they are fed by Slate's pointer pipeline, so binding a controller
	 * touchpad to them means synthesising a screen touch at a screen position, for a surface that has no
	 * screen position -- and a Slate pointer press moves that player's focus to whatever widget it lands
	 * on, which is how tapping the pad used to kill the controller's buttons (see ProcessTouchState).
	 *
	 * A controller touchpad is not a touchscreen; it is part of one player's gamepad, exactly like that
	 * player's right stick. So it is registered like one. Enhanced Input binds JoyShock TouchPad 1 as a 2D
	 * axis the same way it binds a thumbstick, routed to the player who owns the controller, with no
	 * pointer, no focus and no window coordinates involved.
	 *
	 * Both fingers the hardware reports get a pad. Each is centred like a stick -- (0, 0) is the middle of
	 * the surface, X runs left to right and Y runs bottom to top, matching the sticks so a shared Enhanced
	 * Input mapping (To World Space included) behaves the same on both. Not touching reads as (0, 0), which
	 * a corner-relative 0..1 range could not express: there, "no finger" and "finger at the top-left corner"
	 * would be the same value. Touched says which it is.
