# JoyShockLibrary4Unreal

An Unreal Engine plugin that talks to PlayStation and Nintendo controllers over HID, and reports them to
Unreal as ordinary input devices with motion, rumble, lights and per-player assignment.

This file is for **changing** the plugin. Using it is the README's job, and the README is long and current
— read it before writing code here.

| Question | README section |
|---|---|
| Where does anything live? | *Source layout* — three layers, and the folder tells you which |
| I want to change X, where do I go? | *Where to change what* |
| What will bite me? | *Things worth knowing before changing any of it* |
| What does a game actually call? | *Blueprint nodes*, *Reacting to controllers* |

## Building

The editor must be **closed**. Live Coding holds the module open and blocks the whole build without
reporting a compile error — a build that "does nothing" is almost always an editor still running.

```bash
"<UE install>/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Build.bat" <Project>Editor Win64 Development -Project="<path>/<Project>.uproject" -WaitMutex
```

**A green build does not prove the includes are right.** UBT compiles this module as one unity blob, so a
`.cpp` missing an `#include` is handed the declaration by whichever neighbour happens to be concatenated
before it, and compiles anyway — until someone reorders files, or builds elsewhere. `-DisableUnity` on the
command line does *not* reach this module. To check properly, add `bUseUnity = false;` next to `PCHUsage`
in `JoyShockLibrary4Unreal.Build.cs`, build, then take it out again. Worth doing after any change that
moves functions between files. (The 2026-08 refactor was green in unity with a missing include in it.)

`Binaries/` and `Intermediate/` are generated; deleting them is always safe and never the fix for a real
compile error. Public headers with `UCLASS`/`USTRUCT`/`UFUNCTION` need their own `.generated.h` include —
UHT regenerates those, but only for headers it can see.

## What counts as verified

Compiling is not working. This plugin's whole job is hardware that an agent cannot reach: no controller
answers in a container, and the failures that matter here — a dropped Bluetooth link, a stick reading
inverted, a rumble packet that never lands — are all invisible to the compiler.

So: **say which of the three you did.** Compiled / compiled and ran / tested on the actual controller. Do
not describe untested code as working, and name the hardware whoever tests it will need — the README's
*Asking for a test* says who owns what, so that request can go to someone who can actually answer it.

**Standalone is the honest test, not PIE.** Play-In-Editor masks at least two classes of bug this codebase
has actually shipped: input focus problems that only appear with more than one player, and re-entrancy
that PIE's timing happens to hide.

There are **no automated tests** in this repository. Any tool reporting "test coverage" here is reporting
zero for everything; do not read that as a finding, and do not promise coverage that does not exist.

## Invariants the compiler cannot check

The README lists four (sole writer of output reports; no blocking HID under `_connectedLock`; identity is
MAC-or-path; `UJoyShockLibrary` and node names cannot be renamed). These are the rest — each one was
learned by breaking it.

**Never re-run a controller's init or configuration exchange on a live Bluetooth stream.** An init
handshake, a feature-report read or a repeated subcommand disturbs the link: the controller goes quiet,
the read timeouts expire, and the poll loop retires a controller that was working perfectly. This has been
rediscovered four separate times, each with a plausible reason (waking a quiet controller, re-asserting
the HOME light, re-initialising an already-connected DS4, a periodic "wakeup"), each costing a working
controller. Only write-only single-report output — rumble, player LEDs — is safe to repeat mid-stream. To
make an output reliable, re-send on an explicit request, never on a timer: the HOME light uses a
generation counter bumped by each `JSL4USetHomeLight` call, so one call means exactly one write. When a
controller is quiet, do nothing — `hid_read` returning 0 means present-but-silent and recovers for free,
while -1 is the genuine disconnect that reconnects cleanly.

**No background thread may resolve the module through `FModuleManager` — `GetInstance()` included.** A
polling or enumeration thread must be handed the module reference its caller already holds, resolved once
when the thread started. `FModuleManager::UnloadModule` clears the module's ready flag *before* calling
`ShutdownModule`, and off the game thread `GetModule` then answers null, so `LoadModuleChecked` fails its
own check — during exactly the window in which module shutdown is waiting for those threads to stop. The
resulting crash reports a three-frame call stack that names nothing but `GetInstance`. Splitting a
function out of a polling loop is how this gets reintroduced: the loop resolved the module once at the
top, and the new function looks like it may simply ask again.

**Never broadcast a game-visible event straight from `IPlatformInputDeviceMapper`'s connection delegate.**
It looks like a neutral engine signal, but the thing raising it is this plugin's own
`Internal_MapInputDeviceToUser` inside `RefreshPlayerAssignments()` — so it fires re-entrantly, inside our
connect handling, with the container lock held and the player slot only half assigned. Queue the change
and drain it from a ticker on a later frame, the way `SendControllerEvents` and
`UJSL4UWaitForAnyControllerChanges::DrainPending` already do. Getting this wrong cost a full debugging
round: spawning failed in standalone only, and looked like a demo bug.

**A right stick's Y is normalised in exactly one place.** Every family flips it somewhere, and two flips
that each look correct in isolation cancel out. A whole controller (Pro, Pro 2, DS4, DualSense) is flipped
in the parser, `InputHelpers.cpp`; a Joy-Con half is flipped **only** in the interface,
`ProcessAnalogInputs` — so the parser must leave a Joy-Con's `stickRY` alone. This has bitten twice: once
a family normalised nowhere, once a Joy-Con 2 normalised twice. Check both places before touching either
sign.

**Connection Id is the only address a game is given.** The `JSL4U*` nodes take an `int64 ConnectionId`;
the library's own `int32` handle is internal and gets reused, so the controller it names today is not
necessarily the one it named a moment ago. Functions ending in `...ForHandle` are the inside of the
plugin, for paths that already hold a handle from the callback that raised them. Do not widen a handle
into the public API.

**No CoreRedirects, ever — function, class, property or pin.** There are none in this repository and that
is deliberate. Every Blueprint-exposed `UFUNCTION`'s C++ symbol must equal its `DisplayName` with spaces
and hyphens removed (`JSL4UGetJoyConPartner` ↔ `"JSL4U Get Joy-Con Partner"`), because UE's Find-in-
Blueprints and a placed node's stored `MemberName` match the declared name, not the displayed one — a
divergent name is a node nobody can find. Keep the `DisplayName` metadata even when it is only the spaced
form, since UE's auto-derived string mangles the `JSL4U` prefix. Renaming a node breaks every already
placed instance in `Content/`, and those can only be repaired in the editor: find them by grepping the
`.uasset` binaries for the old symbol and tell the user which assets to re-point.

## Conventions

- **Code, comments and commit messages are in English**, regardless of the language of the conversation.
- **Comments say why, not what.** The existing ones explain the constraint that made the code look like
  that — which invariant it protects, what broke when it was written differently. Match that; a comment
  restating the line below it is noise here.
- **`JSL4U` prefixes everything a game sees**, and see the naming rule above before adding a node.
- **A new event is an async `WaitFor*` node**, in the shape of GAS's latent actions — not a delegate the
  game has to bind by hand.
- **The polling thread owns output.** A setter stores what the game asked for and returns; the thread
  decides when it reaches the hardware.

<!-- code-review-graph MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes_tool` or `query_graph_tool` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius_tool` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes_tool` + `get_review_context_tool` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph_tool` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview_tool` + `list_communities_tool`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
| ------ | ---------- |
| `detect_changes_tool` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context_tool` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius_tool` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows_tool` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph_tool` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes_tool` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview_tool` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes_tool` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows_tool` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph_tool` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage — but see *What counts as verified*: there
   are no tests, so it always answers none.
